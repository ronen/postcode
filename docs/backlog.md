# Backlog

This backlog records worthwhile work and concerns that arise outside an active plan or authorized task. An entry is a candidate for consideration, not a commitment or authorization to implement. Its presence means that it remains open; no separate status is needed.

Keep entries concise but sufficiently contextual to remain intelligible. Remove an entry when it is incorporated into a plan, resolved, or declined. Carry any context worth preserving into the resulting plan or decision; Git retains the backlog's history. A consequential choice not to pursue something may warrant a decision record, but routine pruning does not.

The human evaluates backlog entries during planning as appropriate. Coding agents may add entries when directed by the development workflow, but must not prioritize, promote, implement, or remove them without human direction.

## Candidates

## Evaluate independent TypeScript versions for building and analysis

Added: 2026-09-14
Origin: human-directed process review of implementation conventions
Area: toolchain and TypeScript language integration

The current dependency layout uses one installed TypeScript version both to build and type-check PostCode and to analyze subject projects at runtime. Evaluate whether to separate those roles so the build-time compiler can evolve for development convenience while the runtime analyzer remains deliberately pinned and changes only with semantic fixtures and analysis-identity review. Preserve a clear account of which analyzer version establishes each result. If the roles are separated, revise the implementation convention so build-only TypeScript upgrades no longer require runtime-analyzer semantic verification.
